**Skills:**

To start with, Iâ€™m skilled at using tools like Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). I can manage containers with Kubernetes and Docker, and I also have good experience with configuration management tools like Ansible. I also have hands-on experience with AWS and Terraform to set up and manage infrastructure.

**Experience/Education:**

In 2021, I earned my degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering. After that, I worked for Buildbot Technologies for more than a year as a DevOps engineer. Throughout my employment, I specialized in automating and optimizing development workflows, particularly through scalable CI/CD pipelines and configuration management.

**Type of Person:**

I am always eager to learn new technologies and actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills.

### 2. Why did you leave your previous company?

I left my old job to grow in my career and take on new challenges. While I enjoyed my time there, I felt ready for something new. Plus, I wanted to be closer to my hometown.

or 

I quit my previous work to advance in my profession and take on new challenges. Even though I had a great time there, I was ready for something different. I also desired to live nearer to my hometown.

### 4. How soon can you join?

I can join immediately as I am currently not employed and do not have any notice period to fulfill. I am ready to start at your earliest convenience.

### 5. What are your day-to-day tasks as a DevOps engineer?

On a typical day, I design and maintain CI/CD pipelines, manage infrastructure with Ansible, and collaborate with development and QA teams. I focus on automating tasks to improve efficiency and troubleshoot issues in various environments.

### 6. Can you explain the projects you have worked on?

I worked on a project for a pharmaceutical client where I automated Kubernetes cluster provisioning using Ansible. I also set up GitHub Actions to automate updates to running pods and created Jenkins pipelines to enhance deployment efficiency.

### 7. What would you do if a pipeline breaks at the time of deployment?

If a pipeline breaks during deployment, I would first halt the deployment to prevent further issues. I would then review logs to identify where the failure occurred and determine the cause. Informing the relevant team members is crucial, so I would quickly communicate the issue and our plan.

Next, I would either apply a quick fix or rollback to the previous stable state, ensuring thorough testing before re-deploying. After resolving the immediate problem, I would conduct a root cause analysis to prevent future occurrences and update our processes and documentation accordingly.

### 8. What is DevOps?

DevOps is a methodology focused on enhancing application delivery through automation, maintaining code quality, and ensuring continuous monitoring and testing.

### 9. Why DevOps?

Before DevOps:

- Developers would develop the code.
- System Administrators would create a server.
- Build and Release Engineers would install required tools onto the server.
- Server Administrators would deploy the application.

This process often took 10 days to deliver an application due to its manual and sequential nature, lacking effectiveness and agility.


### 10. What is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. **Planning:**
   - Involves gathering requirements, defining the scope of the project, and planning the timeline and resources needed.
   - Sets the foundation for what the software will achieve and how it will be developed.

2. **Design:**
   - Focuses on creating a blueprint or design for the software based on the requirements gathered.
   - Architects outline the software's structure, user interface, and technical specifications.

3. **Development:**
   - Coding and implementation based on design specifications.
   - Developers build features and integrate components to create the application.

4. **Testing:**
   - Verifying that the software works as intended and meets requirements.
   - Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Releasing and deploying the software into the production environment.
   - Involves installation, configuration, and ensuring readiness for end-users.

### Example: E-commerce Company

- **Planning:** Defining requirements and functionalities for the e-commerce platform.
- **Designing:** Creating wireframes, database schemas, and architectural designs.
- **Building:** Developing front-end and back-end components of the website/application.
- **Testing:** Ensuring functionality and reliability of features like shopping carts and payment gateways.
- **Deployment:** Releasing updates and new features for customer use.

### DevOps Engineer Focus

- **Build:** Automating compilation, packaging, and artifact preparation.
- **Testing:** Implementing automated tests for code quality and reliability.
- **Deployment:** Automating release pipelines for efficient updates to production.

DevOps Engineers enhance software delivery by integrating automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, ensuring frequent and high-quality releases.

## 11. What is the Agile methodology?

Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints.

The Agile framework is an iterative methodology. After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint.
